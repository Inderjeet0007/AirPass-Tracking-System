Security & service quality is an important aspect of airport management. As such, it reflects its evolution from a primary focus on facilities and operations, to a primary focus on delivering a passenger-focused service experience. This project was inspired by the need to assess overall airport performance based on the complete passenger experience from departure to arrival terminals or vice versa â€“ a need that has not yet been addressed to date. Current models of airport service performance segment the role of passenger experience at airports by evaluating the performance of certain service areas or certain stages of passenger travel.  This addresses the shortcoming by focusing on passenger-driven experiences and their underlying service attributes at all processing and non-processing domains at airports. In simple words the objective is to track the passenger and to know his / her current location within the airport. So as to ensure the security of airport and smooth process for passengers from departure to arrival.
